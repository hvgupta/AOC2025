In this repo are my attempts to the AOC2025 problems in Rust.

Each day's attempt can be seen in the respective `day_{day number}/mod.rs`

to run a particular day's code, insert your problem input under that day's folder and then run the command

```bash
cargo run -- {the day number} {part number}
```
